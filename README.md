# Introduction
This repository contains source code for paper ["Estimating Individual Treatment Effects with Time-Varying Confounders"](). 

In this paper, we study the problem of Estimating individual treatment effects with time-varying confounders (as illustrated by a causal graph in the figure below)

We propose Deep Sequential Weighting (DSW) for estimating ITE with time-varying confounders. DSW consists of three main components: representation learning module, balancing module and prediction module.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world EMR datasets ([MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/)). DSW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of PEHE and ATE.

# Requirement
Ubuntu16.04, python 3.6

Install [pytorch 1.4](https://pytorch.org/)

# Data preprocessing
### Synthetic dataset
Simulate the all covariates, treatments and outcomes
```
cd simulation
python simulate_full.py
```

### Semi-synthetic dataset
With a similar simulation process, we construct a semi-synthetic dataset based on a real-world dataset: [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/). 
```
cd simulation
python simulate_mimic.py
```

# Full list of covariates
We show the full list of static demographics and time-varying covariates of sepsis patients obtained from [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/).
